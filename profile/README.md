# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to LiteX Hub

The LiteX Hub hosts collaborative FPGA projects around [LiteX](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex).

## What is LiteX?

The [LiteX framework](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex) provides a convenient and efficient infrastructure to create FPGA Cores/SoCs, to explore various digital design architectures and create [full FPGA based  systems](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/wiki/Projects).
